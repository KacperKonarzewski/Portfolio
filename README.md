# Welcome to My Portfolio!

Hi there! I'm **Kacper**, a passionate programmer with over **12 years** of (non-commercial) experience in the tech world. I started exploring technology at a very young age — I was **3 or 4 years old** when I first began using computers. By the age of **8**, I had already developed a strong curiosity about how games and software are created, which led me to dive into programming.

My journey began with **C#**, and to this day, I feel most at home working with it, particularly within the **.NET** framework. However, my knowledge extends far beyond just C#, as I love learning new languages and exploring different areas of programming (I have just started working as a programmer commercially).

Here are the programming languages I’m proficient in: 
-
| | | 
|--------------|--------------| 
| TypeScript | JavaScript |
 | C++ | C | 
 | C# | Java |
 | PHP | SQL |
 | Dart | Python|

Feel free to explore my projects and get in touch if you'd like to collaborate or learn more about my work!

## Piscine

**Piscine** dictionary is filled with **C** projects from _**42 Warsaw**_. 42 is a network of programming schools that originated in France in 2013, known for its unique, peer-to-peer learning approach. The Piscine (French for "swimming pool") is an intensive 4-week bootcamp where students are immersed in the basics of programming and problem-solving. It serves as an introduction to the school’s curriculum, focusing on practical coding exercises that help build strong foundations in programming.

During the Piscine:

-   I achieved **Level 10**, surpassing many of the program's milestones.
-   Most of my projects were completed with a **100% score**, demonstrating precision and thorough understanding.
-   The few minor issues in some exercises are easily fixable, and they serve as a reminder of how learning is an ongoing process.

The Piscine helped me hone my skills in **C programming**, while also reinforcing my problem-solving abilities and solidifying my passion for tackling complex challenges.

This experience isn’t just a highlight of my journey but a testament to my dedication to learning and growth.

**BSQ** is scored at 0%, but before the end we actually managed to do it fully, sadly norminette destroyed us because of max 25 lines per function, and in the last 10 minutes we didn't manage to fix it and the code broke a little.

## PDF_to_Excel

The **PDF_to_Excel** project involves reading PDFs with inconsistent schemas and extracting data from the text using **regular expressions**. The extracted information is then organized and loaded into an **Excel** file for further analysis and use. This automation significantly improved the efficiency of processing and managing data from unstructured PDF sources.

I completed the project in **17 days** without any external help, as I am the sole programmer in the company. My primary role involves automating company processes, and this project was a key part of that initiative.
